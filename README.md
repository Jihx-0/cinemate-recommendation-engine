# Cinemate 🎬

A sophisticated movie recommendation system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering to deliver personalized movie suggestions.

## 🧠 AI/ML Features

Cinemate uses advanced machine learning algorithms to deliver personalized recommendations:

### Content-Based Filtering
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts movie titles, overviews, and genres into numerical vectors
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between movies based on their content vectors
- **User Profile Creation**: Builds a profile from your liked movies' content vectors

### Collaborative Filtering
- **User Similarity Matrix**: Calculates similarity between users using cosine similarity
- **Rating Patterns**: Analyzes how users rate movies to find taste similarities
- **Neighborhood-Based**: Identifies the most similar users to you

### Hybrid Recommendation System
- **60% Content-Based**: Leverages movie content analysis
- **40% Collaborative**: Utilizes user behavior patterns
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjusts based on available data
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when data is limited

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- TMDb API key (free at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cinemate-recommendation-engine
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your API keys:
   echo "TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   echo "FLASK_SECRET_KEY=$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')" >> .env
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001" >> .env
   ```
   
   **Important**: Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual TMDb API key from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install all dependencies (frontend and backend)
   npm run install:all
   ```

4. **Start the development servers**
   ```bash
   # This starts both frontend and backend concurrently
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Data Source Size Impact**: The current implementation uses ~1,000 movies from TMDb's popular movies API. Larger datasets (10,000+ movies) would significantly improve recommendation accuracy by providing more diverse content vectors for TF-IDF analysis.

- **TF-IDF Match Accuracy**: The `tfidf_scores` variable represents the similarity scores between user preferences and movie content. Higher scores (closer to 1.0) indicate better matches, but accuracy depends heavily on the dataset size and quality of movie metadata (overview, genre, title).

- **Cold Start Problem**: New users with few ratings may receive less accurate recommendations until they rate more movies, as the system needs sufficient data to build reliable user profiles.

- **Genre Coverage**: Limited by TMDb dataset availability and movie metadata quality.

- **Real-time Updates**: Movie data is cached and requires manual refresh to get new releases.
